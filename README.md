# 🏎️ F1 Lap Time Optimiser: ERS + DRS + Tyre Degradation Simulation

This project is a simplified simulation of an F1 car's lap dynamics built in Python. It models the effects of:
- **Hybrid system deployment (ERS)**
- **DRS speed boost in valid zones**
- **Tyre degradation over the lap**
- **Lap time telemetry export**
- **Interactive GUI via Streamlit**

Built as a showcase for vehicle performance engineering roles, especially in the context of Formula 1.
